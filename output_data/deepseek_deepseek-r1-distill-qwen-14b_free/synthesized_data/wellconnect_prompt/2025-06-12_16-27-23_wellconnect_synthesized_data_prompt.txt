Give an example table of 30 rows from WellConnect cohort study dataset. WellConnect is a cohort study on mildly to moderately depressed patients (PHQ-9 within 5 to 15) living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The cohort study aims to investigate how individual characteristics and group composition influence the formation and strength of social connections in ongoing group interventions for people with (mild to moderately severe) depressive symptoms. By collecting detailed data on participants' backgrounds and their social interactions during group sessions, the study will identify which personal traits most strongly predict positive and lasting connections. This information will be used to calibrate and improve a computational model that will guide the formation of future intervention groups, with the goal of enhancing social cohesion while minimizing the risk of negative effects such as symptom contagion. According to the theory of homophily, we expect similar people to be more likely to form social bonds. However, we also expect symptoms to spread through social interactions and have a negative effect due to the mechanism of co-rumination. Only consider patients with mild to moderate depression (so the overall PHQ-9 score must be between 5 and 15). The patients must be individuals from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, so consider the demographic composition of that area. 
        The table must have one row by patient, no missing values and include all the following columns:
